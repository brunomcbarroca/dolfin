"""This module handles the Expression class in Python.

The Expression class needs special handling and is not mapped directly
by SWIG from the C++ interface. Instead, a new Expression class is
created which inherits both from the DOLFIN C++ Expression class and
the ufl Coefficient class.

The resulting Expression class may thus act both as a variable in a
UFL form expression and as a DOLFIN C++ Expression.

This module make heavy use of creation of Expression classes and
instantiation of these dynamically at runtime.

The whole logic behind this somewhat magic behaviour is handle by:

  1) function __new__ in the Expression class
  2) meta class ExpressionMetaClass
  3) function compile_expressions from the compiledmodule/expression
     module
  4) functions create_compiled_expression_class and
     create_python_derived_expression_class

The __new__ method in the Expression class take cares of the logic
when the class Expression is used to create an instance of Expression,
see use cases 1-4 in the docstring of Expression.

The meta class ExpressionMetaClass take care of the logic when a user
subclasses Expression to create a user-defined Expression, see use
cases 3 in the docstring of Expression.

The function compile_expression is a JIT compiler. It compiles and
returns different kinds of cpp.Expression classes, depending on the
arguments. These classes are sent to the
create_compiled_expression_class.
